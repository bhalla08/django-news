Contents of a new news post
*title = 
*slug = 
*author = 
*updated_on = 
*content = 
*created_on = 
*status = a tupple is created of a post to keep draft and
published posts seperated when we ewnder them out as 
templates.

The Meta class inside the model contains metadata. 
We tell Django to sort results in the created_on field
in descending order by default when we query the database.
We specify descending order using the negative prefix.
By doing so, posts published recently will appear first.


The __str__() method is the default human-readable representation 
of the object. Django will use it in many places, such as the 
administration site.


admin.py is used after that to create a different view for the
existing news page..

*Display
	`this shows the following fields
	#title
	#Slug
	#Status
	#Created_on
(The list_display attribute does what its name suggests display the properties mentioned in the tuple in the post list for each post.)

*Search bar
(now we have a search bar at the top of the list, which will search the database from the search_fields attributes. The last attribute prepopulated_fields populates the slug,
now if you create a post the slug will automatically be filled based upon your title.)

*Filter
(If you notice at the right, there is a filter which is filtering the post depending on their Status this is done by the list_filter method.)


 For PostList view we have applied a filter so that only the post with status published be shown in the front end of our blog. Also in the same query, we have arranged all the posts by their creation date. 
 The ( – ) sign before the created_on signifies the latest post would be at the top and so on.

there are several html files pressent in this app.
*index.html
*base.html
*sidebar.html
*post_detail.html



WE HAVE USED MODELS TO CREATE DIFFERENT DATABASE ATTRIBUTES
